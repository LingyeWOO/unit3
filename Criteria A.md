### 1. 1 Definition of the problem

My client, Tuan Anh, is faced with an urgent problem with his shoes, where he is unable to recall when his shoes were last used,
for how long, and for what use. He found me to create an accessible, secured inventory for his 5 paris of shoes, where all information
of his shoes were recorded beforehand, so he is able to identify each easily. additionally, he is also troubled by how his friend
(Rikio) constantly borrows his shoes without asking.

### 1. 2 Proposed solution

To solve this problem, I suggest to create a secured inventory system for his 5 pairs of shoes. The system will enable him to record each trip of his shoes, all properties of the shoes, and the situation(stableness) of each pair, providing him with a clear, straightforward system of shoe management.

I will be using Python as the primary coding language because:

1. We are learning Python right now.
1. Python is a high-level, interpreted and general-purpose dynamic programming language that focuses on code readability. The syntax in Python helps the programmers to do coding in fewer steps as compared to Java or C++, which would be perfect for our client's demand.


### 1.3 TELOS feasibility test
**Technical**: A phone-based software that would be easy to utilize and not require too much user learning.

**Economic**: The system will be built merely by me without being paid and does not require any form of outside money-related issue so it is economically feasible.

**Legal**: There are no legal problems or concerns of an inventory program as such, it is legally feasible.

**Operational**: The only operator of this program will be Tuan Anh himself so it is operational feasible.

**Scheduling**: Owing to the tremendous urgency of this project, the software is expected to be built and tested our by the end of the 2020 school year.


## 2.1 Success criteria

To test if the project is successful, the following successful criterion must be considered while testing. All of the criterions can be found at the first audio recording with Tuan An on Feb.17th.

1. The system should have all properties of the shoes pre-recorded.
1. The system should allow Tuan to record each trip of using his shoes.
1. The system should allow Tuan to record the purpose of his trip.
1. Should be able to tell Tuan the duration of using his shoes.
1. Should be able to send Tuan a reqeust when his friends want to borrow his shoes.
1. Should be a secured login system.
1. Should only be accessible by Tuan Anh himself.
1. Should be able to record the stableness of each pair of his shoes.
