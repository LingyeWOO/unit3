### You have been given 5000 USD to build your dream computer. The only condition is that you cannot buy a prebuilt computer. Describe what parts you would buy, and explain how they work as a system to create a computer.

 --| What I will buy | Function | Justification
 ---|---|---|---
 1|**CPU**: Ryzen 9 3950X | The central processing unit (CPU) of a computer is a piece of hardware that carries out the instructions of a computer program. |it is currently one of the best CPUs on the market. The CPU features an eye-watering 16 cores and 32 threads that operate at a base clock of 3.5GHz. Aside from the vast amount of cores, this multithreaded CPU is also a beast at any task you throw its way.
 2| **RAM**: 64GB of fast (3600MHz) RAM | A computer's Random Access Memory stores data for short-term use.  | it goes a long way with Ryzen processors.
 3| **GPU**: RTX 2080 Ti | A graphics processing unit (GPU) is a specialized electronic circuit designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display device.| An RTX 2080 Ti can run any game, in glorious detail, without flinching.
 4| **Motherboard**: GIGABYTE Z370 AORUS | A motherboard is one of the most essential parts of a computer system. It holds together many of the crucial components of a computer, including the central processing unit (CPU), memory and connectors for input and output devices.| Motherboards provide stability to your system.
 5| **Storage**: WD Black SN750 NVMe SSD.| A storage device is any computing hardware that is used for storing, porting and extracting data files and objects. It can hold and store information both temporarily and permanently, and can be internal or external to a computer, server or any similar computing device. | --
 6| **Power supply unit**: The best PSU for PC gaming | A power supply unit (or PSU) converts mains AC to low-voltage regulated DC power for the internal components of a computer. | Corsair's RM-series power supplies have been an enthusiast favorite for years now. The company has developed a strong reputation as one of the leaders in reliability and warranty service for PSUs.
 7| **System Cooling**| | |
 8| Case||The cooling system serves three important functions. First, it removes excess heat from the engine; second, it maintains the engine operating temperature where it works most efficiently; and finally, it brings the engine up to the right operating temperature as quickly as possible.|
 9|Monitor||In the world of computing, a computer monitor's function is to accurately and clearly display the programs, software or video being shown to the user.|
 
 The idea is to spend the entire budget on building a top tier gaming comupter which requires the highest quality of
 each component of the computer.
