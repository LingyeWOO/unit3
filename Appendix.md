Lingye: Hi Tuan

Tuan: Hi! Good morning!

Lingye: I am your designer for the project. So after reading your requirements, I realized that you want
an accessible record of when your shoes were last used, right?

Tuan: Yes.

Lingye: That is like the first thing, right?

Tuan: yeah.

Lingy: And also how long your shoes were used, right?

Tuan: Yes

Lingye: and also like it should be able to record how stable your shoes are - such as whether theya re broken or clean, or just general situation. And also the brand and material, the purpose of using your shoes, the security system of your shoes. If someone like Rikio
wants to borrows your shoes, they should request through the system, right?

Tuan: Yeah.

Lingye: How many pairs of shoes you have?

Tuan: I have 5 shoes.

Lingye: What else do you want?

Tuan: I think that is fine. I think that is good
