## As a client
The inventory system I am looking for is for my musical instruments. I usually keep them in two places: my house(R1-14) and the small
cafeteria. I am now faced with two problems: 
1. The different kinds of instruments have different materials, therefore require a certain cycle of checkups and repairment, which I 
find hard tracking by memory since I have too many instruments.
1. I am open to people borrowing my instruments while I need to know:
    1. Who took it
    1. When did they take it
    1. When is the expected return time
    1. What exactly did they take
    1. For what purpose did they take my instrument
  
1. Here is the list of instruments I have:

  Small caf | R1-14
  ---|---
  Piano | Bass guitar
  Hand drum | AMP1
  AMP2 | ELectric guitar
  Jazz Drums | Guitar Picks(5)
  Drum sticks (4) | Capo
  Wire(2) | Wire(1)
  Sheet music | Guitar bags(2)

1. I want to be able to:
    1. Send a reminder message when the person borrowed my instruments forgot to return
    1. The program only accessable to myself
  
  ## As a developer
  I am going to develop a "Shoe tracker" software application for Tuan, my client, with a secure login system.
  This software will be installed on his phone and help him track information of his shoes such as: when were them last
  used, which pair was wear, for how long have him used them, how clean were they, the brand and material, etc.
