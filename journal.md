==========
Today we started unit3 with python.
- We defined the many datatypes, and discussed what elements shoudl be included in an ideal rpgramming langugae.
- Then we did the "bubble sort" practice.
- I found python really easy to use(no bracket), and has interesting functionalities.

- What did we do? Include a summary of the Computational Thinking Skills
we have watched a video of the process of the computational thinking skills, which is essential to solve the problems incurred 
in our daily life.
1. Decomposition
1. Pattern recognition
1. Abstraction
1. Algorithm

- What did you learn?
I have learnt how to solve a relatively complicated python problem through the computational thinking skills.
This is effective becuase through breaking down the problem into different parts, we are enabled to define the problems more
throughly without the complicated and wet arguments.

- What questions do you have?
I do not have a question at this point, but i do want to try some more python problems through this new 
method of thinking.

- Also write the name and product of the client you will be developing the Inventory System in Python.

  -- Name: Tuan Anh

  -- Product: Water bottles
