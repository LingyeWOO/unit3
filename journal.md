==========
Today we started unit3 with python.
- We defined the many datatypes, and discussed what elements shoudl be included in an ideal rpgramming langugae.
- Then we did the "bubble sort" practice.
- I found python really easy to use(no bracket), and has interesting functionalities.

===========
- What did we do? Include a summary of the Computational Thinking Skills
we have watched a video of the process of the computational thinking skills, which is essential to solve the problems incurred 
in our daily life.
1. Decomposition
1. Pattern recognition
1. Abstraction
1. Algorithm

- What did you learn?
I have learnt how to solve a relatively complicated python problem through the computational thinking skills.
This is effective becuase through breaking down the problem into different parts, we are enabled to define the problems more
throughly without the complicated and wet arguments.

- What questions do you have?
I do not have a question at this point, but i do want to try some more python problems through this new 
method of thinking.

- Also write the name and product of the client you will be developing the Inventory System in Python.

  -- Name: Tuan Anh

  -- Product: Water bottles

=======================

We started with a warmup about finding the distance between various cities and through this, we learned how to extract tuples from lists. We also defined a function called distance in myLib.py. Following that, we established a record of tasks in order to see what steps need to be taken to create our client's program for Unit 3. Using that, we began the first step which is planning. We had an interview with our client (in my case, Lingye) and I learned about her needs (see RecordOfTasks.md).

Next time, I think I need to start working on establishing what Lingye's needs are in terms of usability.

Today, we started with a warmup called "Bolt versus Cheetah" and learned about acceleration and velocity, converting it to a time given the distance covered. We used math functions such as sqrt and practiced doing mathematical equations using variables.

We then worked on calculating the average salary of a group of people within revealing their personal information and practiced with the reduce function. We used encryption by creating a salt and then hashing it using a separate function. This makes it so that the password can not be seen easily.

For next class, I need to update my Record of Tasks, designStatement, and continue developing the log in/registration system.

Today, we use a book called "automating boring things in Python" to practice strings.This is a good way to learn split, join, and a whole bunch of other commands, which you can see in the stringman.py file under warmups.
In the next lesson, I'll continue to practice these commands to get a better grasp of their grammar and usage.

Today, we begin by warming up with programming without a laptop;It helped me learn how to keep practicing to hone my grammar.After that, we did a Kahoot in the physics section of the computer, which was interesting, a good review of memory and other things.Finally, we discussed the criteria for success with our customers, which can be seen in section A of the standard and in the task log file.
We were given a homework assignment to find an example of software being used in an industry other than computer science.I finished it here.We were also told to practice with the strings because we might have homework in class.Finally, to improve my skills, I want to practice Python more.

Today we have tried the famous and most typical bank problem on python and created a dictionary for that.
We also did the presentations on the profession and their input/output system.
